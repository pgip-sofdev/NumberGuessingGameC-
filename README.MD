This is my first assignment as an intern, making a basic number guessing game in C#/WinForms. 
//It randomly generates a number from 1-1000
//Once the user clicks 'new game', the number is generated and the guess button is enabled.
//Using a comparison operator to calculate the difference between the guessedNumber and the actualNumber, I added a blue/red background to indicate 'warmer' or 'cooler'
//Once the correct number is guessed, the bg color turns green, the guess button is disabled, and the only option is to start a new game.
